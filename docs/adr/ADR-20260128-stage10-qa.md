# ADR-20260128 Stage 10 QA & Stabilization

## Status
- Accepted

## Context
- Stage 10 requires QA validation, error-state review, and minor stability fixes.
- Full device testing is not available in this environment.

## Decision
- Run static QA (flutter analyze + flutter test) and review loading/error/empty states.
- Optimize notification read flow to avoid repeated list refreshes during bulk actions.
- Capture remaining backend contract checks as TODO items.

## Alternatives Considered
- Defer QA until device testing is possible (rejected: Stage 10 milestone).

## Consequences
- Manual on-device QA remains required when backend integration is available.

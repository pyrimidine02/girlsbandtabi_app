# TODO

- Add a HomePage widget test that verifies the ProjectSelector renders during loading and triggers a reload after selection (remove once CI covers the flow).
- Implement the live events calendar view (calendar icon on LiveEventsPage) and apply the same sorting + D-day labels (remove once calendar UI ships).
- Re-verify Swagger for `{projectId}` usage on units endpoints once `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` is reachable, and adjust ID/slug usage if required.
- Implement JWE location token generation for place verification (currently using latitude/longitude payload per `docs/place-verification-endpoints.md`).
- After local endpoint checks, restore development base URL to the shared dev/staging host or make it configurable via env (remove when backend validation is done).
- Confirm backend accepts project slug/code for remaining project-scoped endpoints (places/live/news/verification) and document any exceptions.
- Expand verification error localization map as backend adds new failure reasons.
- Decide whether place detail should show favorites as "좋아요" or a true rating once backend exposes rating data.
- Request backend fix: disable CSRF for `/api/v1/**` or document CSRF token flow for mobile clients (nickname update currently 403).
- Confirm profile update payload handling for optional fields (avatar/bio/cover) when omitted vs empty.
- Add Firebase config files (`google-services.json`, `GoogleService-Info.plist`) and verify Analytics/Crashlytics runtime behavior.
- Define cache key registry + clear-all mechanism for `CacheManager` and map feature TTLs to cache keys.
- Enable OAuth once backend is ready by providing authorize URLs and deep-link redirects.
- Confirm `HomeSummaryDto` field mapping with backend response and adjust parsing keys if needed.
- Confirm `PlaceDetailDto`/`PlaceSummaryDto` field mapping with backend response and adjust parsing keys if needed.
- Implement bounds-based refresh for Places map (current map uses the full list + region filter).
- Confirm whether Places Regions endpoints accept project slug; currently retrying with UUID when the slug call fails.
- Confirm whether visit stats should use `/api/v1/users/me/visits/summary` per place and expand UI if backend adds aggregate stats.
- Provide Android `MAPS_API_KEY` via `local.properties`/CI secrets for Google Maps rendering.
- Revisit chip label color overrides if design tokens change for tags/filters.
- Add UI feedback for large full-list loads (pagination or loading indicator).
- Consider adding geocoding-based search for map lookup (currently local search only).
- Confirm `LiveEventDetailDto`/`LiveEventSummaryDto` field mapping with backend response and adjust parsing keys if needed.
- Confirm `NewsSummaryDto`/`NewsDetailDto` field mapping with backend response and adjust parsing keys if needed.
- Confirm `PostSummaryDto`/`PostDetailDto` field mapping + `projectCode` usage with backend response and adjust parsing keys if needed.
- Confirm `UserProfileDto` and `NotificationSettingsDto` mappings with backend response and adjust parsing keys if needed.
- Confirm avatar upload flow (presigned + confirm URL) is accepted by `PATCH /api/v1/users/me`.
- Confirm `/api/v1/search` query parameter name (`query` vs `q`) and simplify once confirmed.
- Confirm whether production verification requires JWE tokens vs raw latitude/longitude and update payload strategy accordingly.
- Reduce or remove verbose network body logging once verification 400s are resolved.
- Confirm favorites API payload (`targetId`, `targetType`) with backend and adjust mapping if needed.
- Confirm notification item DTO field mapping (`title/body/category/read`) with backend response and adjust parsing keys if needed.
- Remove temporary notification category mapping once backend documents all supported category enums.
- Verify community posts/comments pagination contract (`page`/`size` vs `pageable`) and adjust query params if needed.
- Request backend support for community post image attachments (create/update payload fields + response images list).
- Confirm user profile `bio` and `coverImageUrl` are returned on public profile endpoints (read + update).
- Confirm whether `username` should be an email for registration and align login labels accordingly.
- Confirm unit name/description semantics (`code` vs `displayName`) with backend and update mapping if the contract changes.
- Keep the Flutter code standards guide in sync with AGENTS.md and lint rules.
- Confirm place guide/comment DTO mappings with backend (fields + pagination).
- Confirm place comment creation request (`CreatePlaceCommentRequest`) and photo upload flow (presigned + confirm) with backend.
- Confirm `ProjectDto`/`UnitDto` field mapping and selection persistence expectations with backend.
- Request backend fix: `GET /api/v1/projects/{projectId}/units` returns 500 for existing project (should be 200 empty list or 404 when missing).
- Request backend fix: `/v3/api-docs` returns 500 while Swagger UI relies on `/api-docs/api`.
- Confirm uploads list/approval behavior (URL availability after confirm, approval required before public access).
- Confirm rejected uploads are removed from comments after delete and whether backend clears photo references.
- Remove client-side media URL normalization once backend returns public CDN URLs by default.
- Replace iOS/macOS JPEG fallback with true WebP encoding (preserving metadata) once a supported encoder is available.
- Run on-device QA for Stage 9 flows (search/verification/favorites/notifications/projects/uploads) and record findings.
